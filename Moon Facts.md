# Moon Facts

## Location in the Solar System:

- Earth’s only moon
- Fifth largest moon in the solar system
	- but the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System relative to its parent planet
	- it’s even larger than Pluto
- Equatorial radius of 1080 miles
- Less than a 3rd the width of Earth
- An average distance from Earth of 238,855 miles away
	- this distance will vary from 221,829 to 252,898 miles over the course of a year
	- that distance is about 30 times the diameter of the Earth
	- Getting 1 inch further away from Earth each year

## Orbit:

- elliptical orbit
- Rotates at same rate that it revolves around Earth. So, same hemisphere always faces Earth all of the time
	- this is known as synchronous rotation
- As a result, we never see the far side (or “dark side”) of the Moon from the surface of the Earth
- Moon makes a complete orbit of the Earth in 27 days
- It appears to orbit us every 29.5 days, trick due to the fact that we are moving as well, rotating on our axis, and orbiting the Sun

## Composition:

- solid iron-rich core is 149 miles in radius
- surrounded by a liquid iron shell 56 miles thick
- A partially molten layer 93 miles thick surrounds iron core
- Mantle extends from top of partially molten layer to the bottom of Moon’s crust
- Most likely made of minerals like olivine and pyroxene (made up of magnesium, iron, silicon, and oxygen atoms)
- Crust has a thickness of about 43 miles on Moon’s near side and 93 miles on far side
- Made up of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium, aluminum
- Small amounts of titanium, uranium, thorium, potassium, and hydrogen

## Surface:

- Steady rain of asteroids and meteoroids has left many craters
- Tycho Crater is more than 52 miles wide
- Over billions of years, these impacts have ground the surface of the Moon into fragments ranging from boulders to powder (called the lunar regolith)
- Beneath the powder is a region of fractured bedrock called megaregolith
- Light areas of moon known as the highlands
- Dark areas called Maria (latin for sea). These are impact basins filled w/ lava between 4.2 and 1.2 billion years ago
- These light and dark areas represent rocks of different composition and ages, which provides evidence for how early crust may have crystallized from a lunar magma ocean
- Gravity on the surface of the Moon is about 1/6 of Earth
- Temperature range:
	- 260 degrees F when in full sun
	- -280 degrees in darkness

## Water:
- Although initially thought to be without water, large concentrations of frozen water in the shadowed regions of the north and south poles of the Moon.
- Meteor impacts also releases sub-surface lunar water, most of which is ejected into space

## Atmosphere

- very thin and weak atmosphere, called exosphere
- Does not provide any protection from sun’s radiation or from meteoroids

## Magnetosphere

- early moon may have developed an internal dynamo (mechanism for generating global magnetic fields), but today has a very weak magnetic field (thousands of times weaker than Earth’s)
