# What is Life by Schrödinger

Erwin Schrödinger's "What Is Life?" is a groundbreaking work that delves into the intersection of physics and biology, exploring the fundamental questions about the nature of living organisms. Published in 1944, the book is based on a series of lectures Schrödinger delivered at Trinity College, Dublin, and it profoundly influenced the development of molecular biology. Schrödinger, a renowned physicist best known for his contributions to quantum mechanics, sought to understand life through the principles of physics, particularly thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.
In the initial chapters, Schrödinger addresses the apparent contradiction between the orderly behavior of living organisms and the second law of thermodynamics, which dictates that systems tend towards disorder. He introduces the concept of "negative entropy" (or "negentropy"), suggesting that living organisms maintain order and structure by exporting entropy to their surroundings. This idea was revolutionary because it framed biological processes in terms of physical laws, highlighting how life can sustain itself and grow in apparent defiance of entropy's increase.
Schrödinger then turns his attention to the genetic basis of life, proposing that genetic information is stored in what he called an "aperiodic crystal." This concept was remarkably prescient, as it anticipated the discovery of DNA's structure nearly a decade later. Schrödinger theorized that these molecular structures could carry genetic information in a stable yet mutable form, allowing for the continuity and variability essential for evolution. His insights provided a conceptual framework that inspired researchers like James Watson and Francis Crick in their quest to understand the molecular basis of heredity.
In the latter part of the book, Schrödinger explores the implications of quantum mechanics for biology. He suggests that quantum phenomena could play a role in genetic mutations and other biological processes, although he acknowledges the speculative nature of these ideas. Schrödinger's discussion of quantum mechanics in the context of biology was pioneering, opening new avenues for research and contributing to the nascent field of quantum biology. His willingness to extend physical principles into the biological realm encouraged interdisciplinary approaches that have since become standard in scientific inquiry.
"What Is Life?" concludes with a philosophical reflection on the nature of life and consciousness. Schrödinger touches upon the implications of his scientific insights for understanding the mind and the unity of life. He posits that consciousness and life might be deeply intertwined with the physical structure of the universe, suggesting a holistic view of nature. Schrödinger's work not only bridged the gap between physics and biology but also prompted profound questions about the essence of life and the limits of scientific understanding. The book remains a seminal text, inspiring generations of scientists to explore the fundamental principles underlying living systems.
