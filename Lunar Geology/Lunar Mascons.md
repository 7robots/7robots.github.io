# Lunar Mascons

The Moon is the most gravitationally “lumpy” major body known in the solar system. Its largest mascons can cause a plumb bob to hang about a third of a degree off vertical, pointing toward the mascon, and increase the force of gravity by one-half percent._2([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_concentration_(astronomy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_concentration_(astronomy))

Typical examples of mascon basins on the Moon are the  [Imbrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Imbrium) ,  [Serenitatis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Serenitatis) ,  [Crisium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Crisium)  and  [Orientale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Orientale)  impact basins, all of which exhibit significant topographic depressions and positive gravitational anomalies. Examples of mascon basins on  [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars)  include the  [Argyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyre_Planitia) ,  [Isidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidis_Planitia) , and  [Utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Planitia)  basins. Theoretical considerations imply that a topographic low in  [isostatic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy)  would exhibit a slight negative gravitational anomaly. Thus, the positive gravitational anomalies associated with these impact basins indicate that some form of positive density anomaly must exist within the crust or upper [*mantle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)) that is currently supported by the  [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere) . One possibility is that these anomalies are due to dense  [mare basaltic lavas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare) , which might reach up to 6 kilometers in thickness for the Moon. While these lavas certainly contribute to the observed gravitational anomalies, uplift of the crust-mantle interface is also required to account for their magnitude. Indeed, some mascon basins on the Moon do not appear to be associated with any signs of volcanic activity. Theoretical considerations in either case indicate that all the lunar mascons are super-isostatic (that is, supported above their isostatic positions). The huge expanse of mare basaltic volcanism associated with  [Oceanus Procellarum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus_Procellarum)  does not possess a positive gravitational anomaly.
