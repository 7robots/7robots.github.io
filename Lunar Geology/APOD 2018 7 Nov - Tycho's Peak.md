**Explanation:**  Why is there a large boulder near the center of Tycho's peak? [Tycho crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_(lunar_crater)) on [the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180318.html) is one of the easiest features to see, [visible](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160201.html) even to the unaided eye (inset, lower right). But at the [center of Tycho](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/lro-tycho.html) (inset, upper left) is a something unusualâ€“a 120-meter boulder. This boulder was imaged at very high resolution at sunrise, over the past decade, by the Moon-circling [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/about.html) (LRO). The leading origin hypothesis is that that the boulder was thrown during the [tremendous collision](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140113.html) that formed Tycho crater about 110 million years ago, and by chance came back down right near the center of the [newly-formed central mountain](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/384). Over the next billion years meteor impacts and [moonquakes](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/15mar_moonquakes) should slowly degrade [Tycho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfmQh_yDRBo)'s center, likely causing the central boulder to tumble 2000 meters down to the [crater floor](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/lroc-20100114-tycho.html) and disintegrate.
