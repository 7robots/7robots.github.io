# Lunar Lava Tube

*Lunar lava tubes* are  [lava tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_tubes)  on the  [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon)  formed during the eruption of  [basaltic lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt)  flows. When the surface of a  [lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava)  flow cools, it hardens and the lava can channel beneath the surface in a tube-shaped passage. Once the flow of lava diminishes, the tube may drain, forming a hollow void. Lunar lava tubes are formed on sloped surfaces that range in angle from 0.4° to 6.5°._1([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lava_tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lava_tube)

The existence of a lava tube is sometimes revealed by the presence of a “skylight”, a place in which the roof of the tube has collapsed, leaving a circular hole that can be observed by  [lunar orbiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbiter) ._3([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lava_tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lava_tube)
