    - 2030 no less than 50% below 1990 levels
    - 2040 no less than 75% below 1990 levels
    - 2050 net zero
- S. 9: Offshore Wind
    - authorizes MA to procure an dditional 2400 MW of offshore wind power
    - would bring our total required authorization to 4000 MW by 2027
    - we got federal permitting approval
    - utilities recently issued issued 3rd offshore wind RfP
    - vineyard wind cleared for construction

- S.9 Energy Efficiency
    - 15 new products to MA standards
    - minimum performance standards
    - goes into effect Jan 2022
    - better alignment of energy efficiency standards with emissions reduction goals
- S.9 Environmental Justice
    - defines environmental justice and burdens, including climatae change as an environmental burden
    - expands Mass environmental Policy Act (MEPA) review to require an env impact report for aall projectects that impact air quality w/in 1 mile of an env justic neighborhood
    - requires the Dept of Env Protiection to conduct stakeholder process to develop a cumulative impact analysis as a condition for permitting certain projects
        - entire pollution burden over time, not just current/immediate project under review
- 2050 Decarbonaziation Roadmap
    - examined 8 economy-wide decarbonization scenarios thru 2050
    - provies technologies, implentation options and overall cost
    - summary report + 6 technical reports, each detailing analysis and detailed conclsuions by section
- Top-Level finddsings
    - it IS achievable if we are smart about our approach and strategies
    - leveral existing lifecycle replacmenet schedules
    - can do so affordably
    - maintain a thriving economy
    - ensure we bring everyone along, especially most vulnerable residents
- More Key Findings
    - balanced clean energy portfoliio anchored by a signifcant offshore wind resource
    - more interstation transmission to allow us to access renewable gneration ion other states and in Canad
    - widespred electriciation of transportaiton and building heat
    - reduce cost by replacing energy infrastructure at end of service life
- 2030 Clean Energy and Climate Plan
    - long term 2050 goals needs to inform our shorter term goals for 2030
    - good planning for lifecycle, foster innovation
    - bring down costs
    - this is the decade for action
    - retrofit over a million homes
    - 15% reduction in miles traveled
    - increase EV’s by 750k
- S.9 Next Steps
    - develop and finalize the climate and clean energy plan
    - include 2025 and 2030 intermediate goals
    - figure out increasing carbon storage (forest mgmt)
    - benefits to env justice communities?
    - additional year of planning
    - more opportunities for engagement w/ stakeholders and public
    - commision on clean heat begins next month
        - how to decarbonize heating sector
- First-in-the-nation commission on Clean Heat
    - wide range of impacted parties and experts
    - will provide recommendatiosn to governaor aroudn the futture of clean heat
    - 2021: long-term declining caps on heating fule emissions (gas, oil, propane) to be established in regulations by MassDEP in 2022
    - 2022: commission to focus on devleoping supprting policies to transition towards clean heat and meet the cap
    - commission will be convened in May/June, supported by inter-agency task foce
- Vehicle Electrification
    - MOR-EV program
        - expanded rebate eligibility to incluce commerical and non-profit fleets to maintain deman
        - expaned MOR-EV to ibnclue truckes, medium, and heavy duty vehicles
        - additional incentives avaiabile for vehicles in EJ communites
    - Fleet Advisory Program
        - will provide tech assistance to fleet managers to plan and produce medium and eavy electric vehicle fleets
    - Transproration and Climate Initiative Program (TCI-P)
        - will reduce transportation emissions by 26% and provide over $160 million annually to invest in clean transportation
- Climate Adaptation
    - municipal vulnerability preparedness (MVP) program
        - 89 percent of communities enrolled
        - $44 million awarded to date
    - RMAT Climaate Resilience Design Standards Tool
        - help assess climate change risk of planned projects
        - provies recommenations to make the designs more resilient
- Questions
    - carbon sequestration: wasn’t previously been tracked on by various groups and legislative commissions
    - going forward:
        - create an inventory
        - track carbon credits
        - determine practices for sustainable mgmt
    - technologies for carbon capture? not yet economically viable but federal investment is increasing, may be opportunities in the future
    - incentives for individuals or companies to move to clean energy
