- Susan Cutter, Univ of S. Carolina
    - Spatial Inequalities in Climate-Sensitive Hazard Impacts
    - disaster risk has changed
        - new understanding includes non-linear change, interdependencies, systems, etc.
        - hazard, exposure, vunl, scale, systems
    - new methods, tools, geospatial data, social media data, satellite imaging, etc.
    - changes in disaster governance
        - state, policies, social, private sector actors
        - prepare, mitigate, respond, recover
    - inequalities in disaster risk persist
        - rich v poor
        - gender
        - technology
        - age
    - variability in event type and loss patterns
        - most hazard events versus highest losses versus most fatalities
            - counties and states all over the map on these axes
    - post 1980 climate sensitive county $$ loss patterns
        - especially acute in coastal counties
    - county per capita lost
        - greatest loss of life in central states and west
            - flooding and fires
        - per capita losses increasing overall since 1980
    - assessing spaital impacts via relative losses
        - ratio of property loss/county GDP
    - assess differential impacts using social vulnerability
        - social vuln index (SoVI) measures social disparities in disaster impacts, preparedness, response, recovery among places
    - what gets measured, gets managed
        - assess impact inequality using social vulnerability with maps
    - Approah to reducing inequality in disaster
        - SoVI coupled with FEMA erified loss counts tells the story of where resources are needed to support disaster relief
        - this was tried in 2016 flooding in LA — good evidence-based support for this approach
    - SC has a migitation program ($157M) with risk profiles using SoVI as one of the metrics
    - National Risk Index
        - SoVI
        - BRIC (community reslience)
        - Expected Annual Loss (SHELDUS database)
    - climate disasters increases inquality and expand
- Marshall Shepherd, Univ of Georga
    - The Extreme Weather Climate Gap: risk and vulnerabilities
    - 2021 saw multiple billion dollar weather and climate disasters
    - working on a committee analysing effects of multiple compounding disasters of gulf area on marginalized, disadvantaged communitie
    - these climate disaster impacts are here now, not future tense
    - so what?
        - air pollution, increasing allergens
        - extreme heat
        - severe weather
        - env degradation
        - degraded living conditions and social inqualities
        - changes in vector ecology
        - water and food supply impacts
        - water quality impacts
    - parts of world exceeding limits of habitability
    - extremes are becoming more extreme and people feel them far more than “averages”
    - the DNA of climate change is already in current weather patterns
    - climate risk is expected to increase
    - climate risk in the 2040’s
        - skewed towards coasts, southwest, florida,
    - extremely confident in decreasing cold and increasing heat
    - weather-climate gap
        - disproprit sensitity to extreme weather cliamte events and a delay in ability to bounce back
        - heat islands in major metro areas
            - black communities in particular tend to fall in these heat islands
        - flooding on large paved areas also tend to focus on black communities
        - communities of color, children, older adults, lower income communities are bulls-eye of impact
- David Keith, Harvard
    - What is known about the geography of solar geoengineering’s risks and benefits
    - economy → emissions → concentrations → climate change → impacts
    - 4 types of interventions
        - decarbonization
        - carbon removal
        - solar engineering
        - adaptation
    - note: decarbonization only stops things getting worse, but doesn’t stop it
        - carbon removal and solar engineering required to reverse impact
    - options for geo-engineering
        - space-based methods (big sun blocks in orbit)
        - increase stratospheric aresosol
        - decreasing amount of high altitute cirrus clouds
        - increase reflectivity of marine clouds
        - surface albedo enhancement
    - past concerns about talking about geo-engineering because it gets polluters and policy-makers off the hook from change is decreasing quickly
        - global forums, univ and federal research effort
    - the physical geography of consequences of geo-engineering
        - what does the science say?
        - would depend on the choices we make
    - geoengineering cannot replace emissions cuts but can supplement it
    - 2019 model of decreasing half of global temp increase to pre-industrial levels
        - across variables: surface air temp, max annual temp, precip - evap, max 5 day precip
        - no significant increases in climate risk across any of 4 variables with geo-engineering outcome of temp decrease
    - still lots of concerns about solar geoengineering
        - physical risks
            - unintended outcomes of intervention
        - injustice
            - does increase inquality
        - conflict
            - used as a weopon
        - humantity and nature
    - still lots of skepticism, but that’s changing
    - poorer, more vulnerable countries more willing to consider geo-engineering interventions

        - worry and perceived risks
            - on average, women typically said they were less knowledgeable but more worried
            - in US, 3/4 said that theywere somewhat or very worried, versus half of men
                - similar in Australia, Canada
        - people less likely to perceive personal harm, but more likely to be aware of future harm
