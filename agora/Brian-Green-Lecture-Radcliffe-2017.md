# Brian-Green-Lecture-Radcliffe-2017

- Introduction
    - Nod to Drew Faust on her retirement at end of academic year
    - Brian is on board of overseers
- April 1955, Albert Einstein on his death bed hospital bed at Princeton Hospital
    - Pad of paper w/ equations
    - Continuing to work quest for over 30 years on “unified theory” stitching together forces of nature into 1 explanatory equation
- 1 key question re: search to understand deep fundamental forces of nature
    - How did the universe begin?
    - We have theories
        - Big Bang
    - We can take mathematics and wind the universe in reverse to a fraction of a second after beginning
    - To go further back in time (to true time 0), the math breaks down
- Can we find a math formula to even explain conditions at time 0 or earlier?
- These questions go back to at least Isaac Newton
    - During black death, he retreated to his family’s country home, did a huge amount of work on theory, observation, math, etc.
        - Universal law of gravity came from this period
            - Gravitational force defined by how big objects are and their distance from each other
            - His math mostly works for celestial objects “breathtaking” predictive power
            - He also found something “embarassing” his math could describe the force of gravity but couldn’t say how gravity actually works! What is the mechanism?
            - I leave the question to the reader
- Albert Einstein wants to figure out how gravity actually works
    - 10 long years on this
    - The rubber sheet analogy w/ the bowling ball causing deformations and other balls movement being affected by the deformation
    - He gave us both the analogy and the actual equations to describe
    - Observational data, over time, proved that Einstein’s equations were confirmed his theory of general relativity
- Gravitational ripples in fabric of space created by two dense objects rotating around one another in space
    - Harder to test/observe than other dynamic systems
- Several decades of work
    - Einstein never thought the gravitational waves would ever be detected
    - Kip Thorne and others posited an experiment
- Sept 14 2015 2 different gravity wave detectors (LIGO’s) independently confirmed gravitational ripples generated by collision of 2 black holes 1.3 billion light years away (1.3 billion years ago)
    - LIGO Hanford
    - LIGO Livingston
    - This experiment first turned on 2 light days in advance of the wave actually hitting earth
- Quantum Mechanics
    - Theories first emerged during Einstein’s lifetime. He didn’t really like it
    - Particle-wave duality
    - Quantum tunneling
        - On sub-atomic layer, electrons DO occasionally pass thru impermeable walls
- Problem there’s a feature of Quantum Mechanics that conflicts w/ General Theory of Relativity
    - Uncertainty Principle we cannot, with precision, predict with certainty both the position and velocity of an object at the same time
    - Uncertainty reigns in the microscopic world
    - This uncertainty also applies to the fabric of space-time and, therefore, disrupts Relativity
    - Einstein’s geometry works at macroscopic layer but not at the frothy_uncertain_undulating conditions at the smallest scale of reality
- Intro to String Theory
- Note that String Theory does not yet have experimental verification of its theory the way that relativity and QM have enjoyed
- Question — what is the smallest constituent element of reality?
    - Greeks defined It as atom
    - But we know that atoms can be split into
        - Electrons, protons, neutrons
        - Some of those particles can be broken up into even smaller elements like quarks
- String Theory hypothesizes that smallest element of nature is a string or loop or filament that oscillates or vibrates and the different types of vibration are what creates different kinds of sub-atomic particles
- Mid 1980’s when mathematics behind string theory first emerged
- The math also suggested a unification of QM and relativity
- But String Theory also suggests that the universe may also contain additional dimensions beyond the traditional 3
- Question — standard model has a bunch of standard number re: mass and other characteristics (size ,charge, etc.) of various particples in the atomic zoo
    - But why these numbers?
    - Even small differences in these numbers could create huge changes in nature of universe
    - 20 numbers each describe different ways that the strings can vibrate
- Strings also vibrate in the curled up additional dimensions
    - If we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like, we could finish the vibration calculations of the string and, thus, be able to derive the WHY of each standard model number
- Hints of a multiverse where other universes are built on different standard model numbers?
- The theoretical work continues. Many questions unanswered but worth pursuing
