# Event-Horizon-Team-2022

- The Event Horizon Team created the first ever image of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy
- Panelists:
    - moderator Ellen Stofan, Smithsonian Under Secretary for Science
    - Kari Haworth CTO at CFA
    - astrophysicists Angelo Ricarte and Paul Tiede
    - Shep Doeleman
- the EHT is really a virtual telescope that brings in images from multiple telescopes from around the world
- requires:
    - multiple radio telescopes
    - each with a hydrogen maser clock
    - hard drive that ships the data to a central correlator
        - 80 terabyte packs of disks
    - very long baseline interferometry
- m87 was in a giant elliptical galaxy
    - center was pretty simple
- m87
    - size our solar system, 6 billion times more dense than our sun
- milky way
    - Saggitarius A black hole
    - size of orbit of mercury, 1000 times more dense
    - matter orbits a lot faster around SgA since it’s so much smaller
- what’s next for the EHT?
    - key questions i black hole science
    - how do we make sense of the dynamic environment around the black hole?
        - making movies of what’s happening around these blackholes
