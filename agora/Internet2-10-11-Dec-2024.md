## IPv6-only on LHC at CERN

- Summary:
    - The WLCG, a global computing grid for high-energy physics, is transitioning to IPv6 due to IPv4 exhaustion and security concerns. The HEPIX IPv6 WG has been instrumental in this transition, with most storage now dual-stack and a goal to make all WLCG services dual-stack. While IPv6-only networks are being implemented, challenges remain, including complex configurations and a lack of local expertise.
- Salon G
- Agenda:
    - WLCG
    - IPv6 requirement and HEPIX IPv6 WG
    - Phases
    - IPv6 in 2024 data challenge
- WLCG (worldwide LHC computing grid)
    - More than 170 computing centers
    - Sites in 3 tiers
        - Tier 0 CERN
        - Tier 1 national laboratories
        - Tier 2’s 160 university physics dpeamrnts
    - 2 network

    - Some sites running out of IPv4
    - Surveyed for IPv6 readiness
    - Factors
        - Opportunistic deployments
        - Middleware and software often not v6 capable le
        - Performance: avoide NAT’s proxies
    - more recent reasons to deploy v6
        - US government directive M-21-07 — applies to WLCG facilities at Fermilab and Brookhaven
    - SciTags — accountability for traffic
        - Per flow labels for science
    - Slow pace of IPv6 deployment in R&E networks
        - NREN. Backbones have been dual stack since early 2000’s
        - Campuses well behind ISPs
- HEPIX IPv6 WG
    - Assistant nd drive WLCG adoption of IPv6
    - Chaired by Dave Kelsey
    - Phase 1 (2011-2016)
        - Analysis of work
        - Review of apples, middleware, systems, tools, security

        - Almost 100% is now dual stack
        - Slow and steady
    - Phase 3 IPv6 only (started in 2019)
        - Goal to simplify complexity and streamline security
        - Positive examples of worldwide infra (like facebook) that IPv6 only
            - But FB is monolithic
        - To bey IPv6 only would have to expand to worker nodes (this is harder)
- IPv6 only WN’s and Ce’s
    - 63% of in scope worker nodes now dual stack and 23# in progress
- Issues reported
    - Delays where IPv6 migration is coupled iwth other projects
    - Some sites have complex configs with respec tot NAT and global IPv6

    - Concern that WN’s behind NAT would be more exposed
    - Lack of local expertise
    - 5% of sites have not responded
    - 9% on hold
- IPv6 and 9000 MTU
    - Throughput significantly improved by jumbo frames

## Scalable Mgmt of VPCs 4-4:20 Salon G

- Summary:
    - VPCs offer scalable and flexible virtual networks with customizable CIDR and security features. Design patterns like mesh, hub and spoke, and VPC lattice provide isolation and service sharing. Firewall strategies, such as centralization, depend on cloud topology and practicality.
- Joseph Rafferty at A&M
- Primer
    - Definition of VPC
    - Virtual network dedicated to your account
    - Customizable: CIDR
    - Deny by default
    - Scalable and flexible (create multiple vpc’s to add more logical isolation
    - Scales to match your infra
    - SG’s
        - Deny by default
    - NACL’s
        - Allow by default
    - Inbound and outbound rules
    - No broadcast traffic, no layer 2 threat
- VPC patterns
    - Mesh - every VPC connects to every other, as necessary
        - Peerings can explode in complexity as the VPC count increases
        - CIDR coordination important
    - hub and spoke
        - With shared services in the hub
        - Note: the VPC in the middle isn’t transitive
    - hub and spoke with TGW
        - Has route tables, can transit traffic
        - Trade-off is cost
    - VPC lattice
        - Leave most isolated
        - VPC lattice service network
        - This “pulls” specific services from a VPC to make it available to other VPC’s
            - Not too dissimilar to exposing an endpoint
- VPC Design
    - Shared VPC
        - Multiple apps in VPC with multiple linked accounts
        - Public and private subnets would span multiple accounts in the shared VPC
    - account-specific VPC’s
- Firewalls
    - Cloud topology differs from on-premises
    - Centralize or not centralize?
    - What’s possible, what’s practical
    - Possible to centralize both Ingres and egress with a central VPC

## Protecting R&E data protection in the quantum age

- Summary:
    - Quantum computing poses a significant threat to traditional encryption methods, particularly asymmetric cryptography used for key agreement and authentication. To mitigate this risk, a multi-layered approach is needed, including quantum key distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms for data encryption. Nokia is actively involved in developing quantum-safe networks, incorporating QKD, PQC, and a defense-in-depth strategy to protect against future quantum threats.
- Chris Janson, Nokia
- Agenda
    - Securing R&E data in the quantum era
    - Q day and quantum threats
    - Case study: how HellasQCI evaluated quantum protection
    - Quantum safe networking framework
- Relevant Threat Vectors (mostly re: network transmission)
    - Eavesdropping (confidentiality breached)
    - Man-in-the-middle (integrity compromised)
    - Denial of service (availability lost)
- Quantum eavesdropping
    - Unauthorized fiber tap
    - Adversarial optical demux and store
    - Could harvest now and decrypt later
    - Future sate: quantum computer and quantum algorithms
- Quantum Man in the Middle
    - Nothing unique to quantum
    - Intruding switch or server providing bad packets or info
- DoS attack
    - Injecting illiterate traffic to overwhelm
    - Nothing unique to quantum
- Today’s focus will mostly be on eavesdropping (confidentiality breached)
- The Threat: Q-Day
    - A cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) becomes available
    - Researchers have estimate of number of qubits needed
    - Technology is rapidly advancing
    - Not a question of if, but when
- IBM Quantum
    - Heron: 100 X n qubits classical + quantum intelligent orchestration
    - Flamingo (1000 qubits) communication/networking for quantum
    - Kookaburra (10,000 qubits) long range for practical error correction
    - Bluejay (100k qubits) further system scaling and integration
- When does a CRQC become real?
- Quantum computers would break widely-used asymmetric crypto
    - Mostly used for key agreement, authentication
    - E.g. TLS, IPSec, VPN, algorithms like RSA, ECC
    - Threat: Shor’s Algorithm
- Symmetric crypto
- symmetric crypto is still safe
    - Bulk data encryption
    - AES, ChaCha (key distribution)
    - Note: quantum threat to symmetric crypto would be based on Grover’s Algorithm
- Key Distribution
    - Pre-shared keys (manual or automated) still safe
    - Quantum Key Distribution (key distribution channel secured by quantum physics) still safe
    - Key agreement / exchange - key distribution channel secured by asymmetric crypto (this will get broken)
- Ingredients of Quantum safe networks
    - Keys (generation, strength)
        - true random numbers assure key quality, key strength, delivery method
    - Key rotation
    - Locks (encryption) data inflight protected connectivity
- The Threat
    - Harvest Now Decrypt Later
    - Bad actors are already collecting the data
    - Time to plan and deploy
        - New ciphers, new commercial products, system change-outs
- Quantum safe networks elements
    - Addition of quantum physics into OSI stack with quantum enhanced key distribution
    - Layered onto network transmission gear:
        - SLTE optical networking
        - Terrestrial optical networking
        - IP networking
        - Microwave networking
- European Quantum Communications Initiative
    - EuroQCI - secure quantum communication infrastructure spanning EU
    - All 27 EU member states and ESA
    - Terrestrial segment with fiber
    - Space segment based on satellites
    - Will be an integral part of IRIS2
- Example: Athens PoC Quantum Secure Network
- QKD (quantum key distribution)
    - Can be based on quantum entanglement (potentially at risk from heat)
- Note: Nokia is already selling devices for QKD
- Non-entanglement (prepare and measure) stack
    - IDQ
        - Fetch encryption requirements and distribute classical keys
        - Their services use this prepare and measure technique
    - Evolutions informs KMS on key requirements
    - Nokia devices
- Note: all of this QKD stuff only protects ONE layer of the stack
    - Protection against quantum computing attacks will need to hit most layers of the stack
- Post Quantum Ciphers (PQC)
    - FIPS 203: Crystals + Kyber (module lattic-based key encryption)
    - FIPS 204: Crystals + Dilithium (module based
    - FIPS 205 SPHINCS+ (stateless has based digital signature
    - Asymmetric Mathematics-based ciphers
    - Kyler is already being used by iMessage and AWS
    - PQC overcomes the fear of Shor’s algorithm
    - All of this is complementary to use of symmetric key distribution for network and physical
- Nokia Quantum safe Network
    - Pre-shared keys with manual symmetric distribution
    - Automated PSK with symmetric distribution
    - Quantum physics hybrid QKD distribution
- Even more future defense in depth approach
    - Layers: physical, Ethernet, network, mpls, IP layers

    - AWS Local Zones (AWS metro presence in 1 Summer)
    - Azure Stack (Azure Local Zone equivalent)
- PoC Testing
    - Test cases
    - Documentation
    - Test framework
    - Networking services
- Test Readout and Recommendations
    - Consolidated findings and recommendations and next steps
- AWS Local Zones
    - Design validation
    - Use case validation
        - EC2
        - ECS
        - RDS
    - Test Results
        - .5ms and 2.5gbit/sec (between Harvard and AWS local zone)
        - Good performance results
    - Lessons learned
        - VPC Service Link is slow
        - Don’t have latest instance types (like m5)
        - We successfully moved:
        - LogicMonitor
        - DrvyvIQ
        - K8s Rancher
        - Several thick client applications
- AWS Outpost (as VMware alternative)
    - Design validation
    - Use case validation
    - Test results look good for network performance and compatible with needs
    - No bare metal support on AWS Outpost
    - Several technical limitations due to lack of features in Outpost server
    - Services
        - EC2 (GP2 instances storage)
        - ECS
    - backup via cohesity not supported
    - Outpost Rack IS a full rack
        - Still paying for full rack and powering full rack (even if you only use some of it)
- Lessons Learned
    - Validat documented features
    - Build skills
- Recommendations
    - Could be an alternative to VMWare
    - Additional TCO required
    - Any use cases that cannot be validated on Outpost server could be validated on Outpost rack
    - Provisions for purchasing rack should include conditions on successful testing
- Azure Stack Goals
    - Design validation Use case
    - Use case validation
    - Services
        - Azure VDI
        - Azure site recovery
        - Database
    - PoC going on right now
    - Observations
        - Time acquire try and buy took a long time
        - Lots of prereq work (Dell paperwork)
        - Much more reasonable hardware costs for full Azure Stack
        - Windows licensing portability
        - Existing windows admin and azure skills should make adoption easier
    - procurement of Azure Stack a lot more flexible than AWS Outposts
    - Observations
        - Vendor docs don’t tell whole story
        - Time consuming PoC
        - Metro cloud or AWs local zones require the lowest LoE
        - Managing edge requires merger of datacenter skills and cloud skills
        - High availability for edge has potential to be very expensive
        - Opportunity to better automate on-premises workloads using cloud native skills
        - Network is crucial for all of these solutions
