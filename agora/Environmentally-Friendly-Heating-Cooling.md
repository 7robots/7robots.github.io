- Accelerating Heat Pumps
- HeatSmart Alliance:
    - Mission: reduce greenhouse gas emissions by accelerating the adoption of energy-efficient heat pumps in MA homes and buildings
    - Applications: home heating and cooling, water heating
    - All volunteer organization
    - 24 MA communities
    - Approach: educate / coach / collaborate
- New England Energy Use
    - 56% trans
    - Resi 30%
    - Indu 13%
    - Commercial 25%
- Average home energy use
    - Heating and cooling is 61%
- Heat Pump IS ready for cold clients
- Existing Central Ductwork
    - Central heat pumps
    - Ground Source (aka geothermal) Heat Pumps
- No ductwork
    - Ductless mini-split systems (single and multi-zone)
- Water heating
    - Heat pump water heaters
    - Aka Hybrid Water Heaters
- Emissions Reduction in metric tons of CO2 per 2000 sq ft home
    - Ground source has the lowest emissions 1
    - Air source heat pump 1.5
    - Natural gas 3.5
    - Propane 3.75
    - Baseboard electric 4.5
    - Fuel oil 5.2
- Heat pump emissions go to practically zero if your electricity is renewable
- MA Clean Energy Plan for 2030
    - Goal: heat pumps across 1 million house holds (out of total of 2.7 million)
- 4 challenges to large-scale residential conversion
    - No sex appeal compared to solar, Tesla, or HVAC
    - Which comes first? Air sealing/insulation versus heat pump
    - Installers assume low cost over carbon savings
        - May try to match existing system type
        - May encourage you to retain fossil system
        - May set swap-over from heat pump to backup cautiously high
        - Heat pumps can heat well insulated/air-sealed MA homes w/out supplemental heat
    - Natural gas is really cheap right now
- 4 actions to accelerate heat pumps
    - Installation
        - Convert to heat pump when heating or cooling is aging (over 15 years old)
            - Don’t wait until system fails and replacement becomes urgent
        - Adding AC to a home that doesn’t have it yet
            - Heat pumps do both heating and cooling
        - Planning an addition, renovation, or new home
    - Become a volunteer coach — help friends, neighbors
        - Replacing heating/cooling is time-consuming and intimidating
        - Coaching works
        - You can become a coach at heatsmartalliance website
    - Ban fossil fuels in new construction (home rule petition)
        - Passed in concord, Lexington, Arlington, acton might do it
    - Advocate for favorable policy
        - MA
            - DOER to set GHG goals for Mass Save by 7/15/2021
                - More aggressive weatherization measures and eliminate incentives for fossil fuel
            - Simplify incentive programs (too many agencies involved)
            - Cap and trade heating fuel emissions
        - Federal
            - Restore 30% tax credit for ground source which sunsets by 2023
                - Now at 26% in 2021
- Peter’s testimonial on ductless mini-splits
    - Installs were around $4k
    - Floor mounted until by Halcyon Single Mini Split Systems
    - Compact cassette mini-split for 2nd floor (ceiling based)
    - The external unit should be a couple of feet off the ground
    - Floor until 100% of heat down to 30 degrees
    - Boiler kicks in below 30 (especially for far rooms)
    - 2nd floor — very good heat even in sub-zero
    - Downsides:
        - Installers oversize and reduce efficiency
        - 1 recommendation 1 head per room (100% coverage but kills efficiency)
        - Multiple needed for large foot print, raising costs
        - Raise units off ground to avoid getting buried in snow
        - Not as simple as boilers
        - Power outage = no heat if no backup
    - Benefits
        - Not setbacks! Now waking at 55f, constant temperature is more efficient
        - 95% effective cooling at low price
        - 100% heat on 2nd story outside of below zero temps
        - Our house had baseboard electric heat and boiler installer recommended heat pump for 2nd floor instead of renovating radiators
        - 1 day installation, very little demolition
    - Costs
        - Installs were about $4000 each in 2018
        - Cooling bill estimated at $50 per months
        - Difficult to discern heating cost but for reference we’ve used an average of 350 gallons oil annually since 2017 install
        - Monthly energy costs $250 — heat, hot water, cooling, cooking, family of 4
- Trevor’s testimonial
    - Our first ground source — single 4 ton w/ electric backup in 2002 in Nova Scotia
    - 2nd install (in Harvard) - 2 four ton ground source heat pumps
        - 100% of heat from heat pumps for last 3.5 years (keeping house at 74 in winter, 76 in summer)
        - Very quiet
    - 6 foot deep trench that has 4 200’ bore holes that follow the driveway
    - Water and ethanol circulates in loop (anti-freeze)
    - Ground loop circulation pumps
    - 2 pumps (load sharing or primary/backup?)
    - From pumps, the heated water goes to an accumulator tank
    - Main control unit with sensors for outdoor temperature and tank
    - Pumps into in floor radiant heat
