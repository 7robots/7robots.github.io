# Sustainable Stow Climate Change 14 Apr 2021

- The way climate change is affecting wild life right now in our area
- Joy Marzoff — the Joy of Nature
    - Www.thejoysofnature.com
    - MA is leading the way
- Climate Change
    - Long term change, different than weather
    - 2020 was the warmest year on record
    - 2016 second highest
    - 2019 third highest
    - 10 of the last 10 years, have been the hottest on record and 19 of the last 20
    - 130 degrees in Death Valley this year!
- Climate Science in 4 pictures
    - Heat-trapping blanket
    - Regular versus rampant carbon dioxide
    - Oceans = climate’s heart
    - Osteoporosis of the sea
- Sightline Institute as a good source
- Blanket of greenhouse gases
    - Carbon dioxide, methane, CFC’s, etc
- Future conditions depend on our actions today
    - Today’s choices
        - File sources for power, transportation, and industry
        - Land development
    - Emission scenarios
    - Future impacts
        - More hot days
        - Increased extreme precipitation
        - Greater amounts of sea level rise
- Methane leakage from natural gas operations (stats from Environmental Defense Fund and PNAS)
    - 59% natural gas production
    - 8% processing
    - 20% transmission and storage
    - 13% local distribution
    - Methane hot spots
- US 2020 Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters
    - How many billion dollar weather events per year? Getting higher each year
    - Wind, flooding, fires, cyclones, hurricanes, tornadoes
    - Last 5 years: total cost in US $600B
    - 5 year annual cost average $121B
    - Last 10 years: $890B (135 events)
    - Last 15 year: 1.04T (173 events)
    - $80B in wildfires in 2020. 3.2 million acres were burned.
- Extreme weather in MA
    - 20 tornadoes in 2019 in CT!
    - Nearly 2 dozen in 2018
    - Other trends:
        - Too much or not enough water
        - More hot days in summer / more dry days
        - Warmer winters (change in snowfall vs rainfall
        - Later / wetter spring
        - Nor’easters increasing in frequency?
- The fires exploding in Oregon and Washington were unprecedent. Not typical for ares of the NW w/ temperate rain forests
    - Smoke even made it to MA!
- Droughts around the world: Australia and S. Africa
    - Last 2 years were hottest on record
    - The dam cracked due to fires. They ran out of water!
- MA
    - Parts of MA already in drought!
    - As recently as Apr 6 — abnormally dry (this is normally a wet month)
    - 2021 was 4th driest first half of March on record (1915 was #1)
    - Dried up vernal pools seem to be decreasing amphibian and good insect populations
    - Warmer winters — affecting our trees
        - Life w/out maple syrup!
- Warmer weather is shifting composition of our forests
    - Current: spruce/fir, maple, beech, birch
    - Over time, northern hardwoods will lose advantage
        - More oak, hickory, beech
    - more poison ivy! (More plants, longer growing season, stronger chemicals due to more carbon dioxide)
    - Screws up hibernation
- Changing seasons around the world
    - Netherlands — change in caterpillar hatching times affects migratory birds
    - 0ver 14M acres of spruce killed by bark beetles
    - Pine beetles impacting trees in US
- changing climate affect wild life
    - Shifting precipitation, total amounts, intensify
        - All causes changes in forest quality, understory, insect numbers, and fire patterns
- Birds and insect hatching getting out of sync
- Migration schedules getting messed up
- Great book: Walden Warming
- Growing season is longer, but so is ragweed
- Forsythia leaf-out is earlier this year
- More fungus diseases on animals and plants around us
- Sea Level Rise
    - Warming causes land and sea ice to melt and sea water to expand
    - Sea levels rising
- annual temperatures in Alaska getting warming
- Sea level in boston expected to rise by 7 inches to 1 foot 6 by 2050
- Most of MIT might be under water!
- Oceans = climate’s heart
    - World’s ocean circulate heat and moisture
    - Marine wild life impact
    - Coral bleaching
    - Ocean acidification
    - Local marine life — lobsters getting disease and/or moving away
    - Reduced calcium buildup for shells, clams, oysters
    - More carbon and more fresh water dumping into ocean increases acidification
    - Food chain disruption
- What can we do?
    - Pluggable hybrid cars
    - Solar panels
    - Energy efficient heat pump systems
    - Rain barrels (for watering the yard!)
    - Efficient shower heads
    - Eat less meat, more veggies
    - Eat local when possible
    - Waste less food - nearly 1/3 of all food in US is wasted, single biggest component of land fills
    - compost!!!
    - Reduce your use of plastics made from fossil fuels (reusable cloth bags)
    - Loe.org article on Carbon fridges that produce HFC’s
    - Join local land trusts
    - Local community efforts like Sustainable Stow
