# NetZero-Tufts-5-Mar-2021

# NetZero America Presentation at Tufts 5 Mar 2021

- CREATE Solutions Speaker Series at Tufts Fletcher School
Study done by Princeton Univ Dec 15 2020[https://environmenthalfcentury.princeton.edu](https://environmenthalfcentury.princeton.edu/)
    - NetZero America: Potential Pathways, Infrastructure and Impacts
    - E. Larson, C. Grieg, J. Jenkins, E. Mayfield, A. Pascal, C Zhang et al
- we use roughly 5 exajoules
- 5 modeled least-cost paths to net-zero in 2050 show implications on different approaches
    - no new policies
    - High electrification (E+)
        - 76% less oil and gas than 2020
    - Less high electrification (E-)
        - uses more fossil fuels
    - Less electrification, high biomass (E-, B+)
        - more biomass used to supplant fossil fuels
    - High electrification, constrained RE (E+, RE-)
        - less biomass to minimize land use problems associated w/ increased biomass
        - Relies on nuclear power and more natural gas w/ carbon capture
    - High electrification, all RE by 2050 (E+, RE+)
        - 100% renewable
        - Fossil and nuclear 100% prohibited
        - Biomass w/ carbon capture and direct air capture
    - 4 key building blocks to all of these options
        - end use energy efficiency and electrification
        - Clean electricity (wind, solar — w/ nuclear and biomass w/ carbon
        - Net zero carbon fuels
        - Carbon capture
    - Good News
        - although transformations are large, all are affordable
        - We eventually spend the same or less on energy as total of GDP by 2050
    - Challenge 1: significant upfront mobilization of capital and labor
        - $2.5T over next decade
        - $830B on wind, solar
        - $530B on distribution
        - $420B on buildings and appliances
        - $360B in industry
        - $130B on Options creation
        - $250b on vehicles
    - Challenge 2: trade offs, not aggregate cots, more real options mean greater probability of success
        - no one scenario dominates
        - Fundamental trade offs in each of them, which challenges are easiest to overcome?
        - May need to keep all options open
        - For example: where electricity more than doubles, solar and wind are cornerstones for each path
            - Need to deploy 600 gigawatts in next decade
            - We did 35 last year, would need to get up to 55-60 on average
        - need to triple the transmission system
            - 1M GW-km required
        - While wind_solar are critical, you have to solve for intermittency (clean_firm)
            - nuclear or biomass or hydrogen or natural gas + carbon capture
            - Learn from Texas issues
            - Need roughly 500 GW of firm power sources
        - Challenge 3: all politics is local, decision support needs to offer gradual guidance and politically silent results
            - affordability and distribution of benefits and costs across the country
            - Most states see net growth in energy-related employee net (500k in next decade, 2-3M by 2050)
            - But major shifts in local economies must be managed
            - Princeton study identifies states where conversion will be most problematic and requires support
            - 200k - 300K premature deaths avoided thru 2050 by a net zero transition (avoids $2-3T in damages)
**## Questions**##
- How might offshore wind positively impact these models?
- What assumptions about capacity? The
