# CFA-Lecture-2021

*Clara Sousa-Silva, Astrochemist, Center for Astrophysics*

- with a sun-like star
    - Looking for methane? would have to be a sewage planet to see it from this far away!
    - phosphine much easier as a bio-signature. No false positives on rocky temperate planets
        - not phoshite and phosphate reduction
        - Not lightning volcanism, etc
        - any detectable amounts of PH3 on a rocky planet cannot be explained without life
    - She published her paper on phosphine as a bio-signature in 2018
    - test: phospine possibly detected in clouds of Venus via ALMA and JCMT?
    - Made the press rounds
    - Venus — something strange is happening
        - Is the signal real?
        - is it phosphine?
        - What is making it?
    - more observations forthcoming
    - will we be better prepared w/ next observation
    - We only spectra for roughly 4% of full range of molecules
        - life could emit 16,367 molecules
    - She’s also working on the UK Twinkle Space Mission
    - she created a new program: ORBYTS
        - Original research by young twinkle scientists
            - each group studying the spectrum of potential bio-molecules
        - Harvard/MIT SRMP (Science Research Mentoring Program)
            - Adapting astrophysics projects to accommodate original research by HS age students
            - SRMP Symposium 2021: May 21 2021 at 3:30pm
        - JURA — STEM for students that don’t quite fit in in normal STEM programs
        - These efforts helping identify spectra for more bio-molecules
        - in reality, the detection of life on another planet will have lots of uncertainty
            - Detecting 1 bio-molecule won’t do it on its own
            - better to have multiple confirming multiple signatures
        - Her biggest concern is that we’ll be pointing telescopes at habited life and miss the signs due to not have the tools/processes to really detect it
- Questions:
    - Are there any ANTI bio-signatures? Detected chemical compounds that rule out life
