**Stavin**
- What will happen w/ US Climate Policy under Biden Administration
    - rejoined Paris Agreement (started process on 1/20, formerly a party again on 2/19)
    - Hard part — Nationally determined contribution (NDC) — how much greenhouse gas will be reduced by 2030
    - Challenging because
        - must be ambitious enough to satisfy domestic green group and key countries
        - Will need to be more ambitious than Obama NDC (26-28% below 2005 by 2025 and 50% by 2030)
        - Must be credible — achievable w/ reasonably anticipated policy actions)
        - Only way both conditions are met w/ new legislation
        - But senate require 60 votes
            - budget reconciliation procure might be used for 51
            - So, prospects for comprehensiveive climate legislation not very good
        - Non-climate legislation could reduce GHG long-term
        - Post-CoViD economic stimulus could have some green elements
        - Infrastructure bill w/ electricity grid updates (for greater reliance on renewable sources and greater penetration of EV)
        - Tax incentives (subsidies) — wind and solar, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power, tech initiatives, EV rebates, etc.
        - these are feasible, but probably not enough
        - Will need to also layer on regulatory actions
        - Regulatory Orders
            - EO’s
                - reinstate and surpass Obama CAFE standards for vehicles
                - Reinstate Obama rule re methane leaking from wells and pipelines
                - Recalculate social cost of carbon
            - Agency actions
                - SEC — disclosure requirements for climate risk
                - Commodity futures trading commission — market risk
            - Congressional review act to nullify rule but
                - must be w/in 60 legislative days of rule’s original adoption
                - Congress must authorize any new reg of substantially same form
            - Challenges to regulation
                - new rules have lengthy notice and comment period
                - Subject to litigation
                - More likely to challenged successfully than during Obama years
                - 245 trump appointed federal judges
                - Supreme Court 6-3 conservative majority
                - Favors literary readings of statutes, less flexible
                - May modify/overrule Chevron Doctrine (under which federal courts defeat to angencies when Congress was not explicit)
                - One striking example — question of whether CO2 may be regulated under parts of Clean Air Act — intended for localized air pollution
            - Other possibilities
                - “whole of government” approach to climate change
                - All departments and agencies consider climate impact of all police and actions
                - Will this really produce in terms of short-term emissions and long-term decarbonizing of economy?
                    - we don’t know
                - State-level policies can be effective
                    - sub-national — California and Northest becoming more important
                    - Bottom-up national policy evolving from Democratic-leaning states
                    - Which represent more than half of US population and an even greater share of economic activity and GHG emissions
                    - best scientists, lawyers, and economists to design sound climate policies that also be politically feasible
                - Links
                    - belfer center on climate
                    - Harvard environmental economic program
                    - Stavin’s personal website
**## Latif**##
- Optimistic about reframing the conversation
- Positive case for action — call for structural change to global economy
- We expect Biden to make a Net Zero commitment in April at a climate conference
- New wave of investment and innovation
- What might “winning” look like?
- Need to make Paris Agreement relevant and talked about at all levels of government
- Optimistic about “whole of government” approach
    - decision-makers across multiple sectors providing currently untold value
- Nudge governments to scan horizon on where they will be in 20 years
    - ideas for incentives for businesses, governments
- Need to mainstream climate thinking
- International Women’s Day
    - disproportionate impact of climate change on women in developing countries and disaster situation
    - 14x more likely to die in a natural disaster
    - Girls 2-3x more likely to not get back to school post-disaster
- Can be a path to a more prosperous future
**Untertell**
- Paris Agreement is having real effect on real economy
- Major trade deal between EU and Mercosur
    - currently blocked about potential risks to Paris Agreement
    - But actively being negotiated
- Climate diplomacy has not yet caught up
- Most of the top 18 major emitters and signers have not updated major emitter goals
- US re-joining Paris and multi-literalism is welcome and very important
    - biggest historical contributor
    - Still 20% of current emissions
- hopefully, Biden admin can be more generous to international green funds
- More trust in multi-lateralism
- Powerful political leverage to push other countries in the right direction
- Trump’s announcement in 2017 de-stabilized trust in US commitments but also encouraged other countries to decrease their contributions
- Biden re-joining is having a positive domino effect
- China and US both need to increase their NDC’s
- Hopeful about India
- Brazil currently moving in the wrong direction (esp. deforestation)
- lots of expectations in bi-lateral and regional contributions by US
