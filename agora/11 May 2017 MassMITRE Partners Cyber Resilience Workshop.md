▾ Remarks by CISO from Partners, Jigar Kadakia
Health care incidents expose more SSN’s than any other industry
Health care hit hardest by both employee error and hacking_skimming_phishing
cybercrime damage to hit $6m annual by 2021
Up to 200 billion devices need securing by 2020
human attack surface to hit 4 billion by 4 billion
▾ What makes health care different?
could have more than 200k endpoints in a hospital
Risk of patient harm
▾ value of information
Patients treat their health data much more sensitively (desire for privacy) than other
types of data
Number/diversity of applications
need to interconnect diverse systems
Number of different users/environments
smaller low-resource organizations are part of critical infra responsible for patient
safety
▾ what is at risk?
PCI, PII, HIPAA, HITECH
CPOE and mobile EHR
Medical devices

DDoS event post-mortem
▾ Regional cyber resilience maturity model
▾ governance
Less mature — no regional organization or ad-hoc at best
more mature - standing mechanisms to collaboratively address resilience are in place,
exercised, and effective
▾ planning and prioritization
Less mature
more mature - regional entities establish shared goals and objectives and assess
performance against plans
▾ funding and investment
Less mature
more mature - funding synchronized to address shared priorities
▾ operationalization
Less mature
more mature - stakeholders consistently collaborate and take collective action
