The moon’s surface contains a [new source of water](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/wsj-explains/nasa-seeks-water-on-the-moon-to-fuel-its-mission-to-get-humans-to-mars/78BA5336-C0D8-469B-8488-41042AB5CBEA?mod=article_inline) found embedded in microscopic glass beads, which might one day help future astronauts produce drinking water, breathable air and even rocket fuel, scientists say.

The findings come from a [Chinese rover](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-moon-mission-ends-as-lunar-probe-returns-to-earth-with-fragments-11608147926?mod=article_inline) that spent two weeks on the moon in 2020. The Chang’e 5 rover drilled several feet into the lunar surface and returned 3.7 pounds of material, among which were the glass beads from an impact crater, [according to a paper published Monday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01159-6) in the journal Nature Geoscience.
