• The universe appears to have a background "hum" or resonance, detected in the cosmic microwave background radiation.

• A new theory proposes that this hum arises from collapsing sheets of spacetime, which could also explain the nature of dark matter.

• These collapsing sheets are predicted by certain models of quantum gravity and could be remnants from the Big Bang.

• The theory suggests dark matter is made up of massive gravitons - hypothetical particles that mediate the force of gravity.

• If confirmed, this could resolve two major mysteries in cosmology and provide a unified explanation for dark matter and the cosmic hum.
