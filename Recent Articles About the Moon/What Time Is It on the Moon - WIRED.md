In 2025, astronauts will begin [returning to the moon](https://www.wired.com/story/why-nasa-wants-to-go-back-to-the-moon/), eventually building bases and [space stations](https://www.wired.com/story/the-capstone-launch-will-kick-off-nasas-artemis-moon-program/), putting robotic landers and rovers to work, and [mining for resources](https://www.wired.com/story/humans-are-revisiting-the-moon-and-the-rules-of-spacefaring/). In this bustling new era of lunar activity, they’ll need to synchronize with each other. But so far there is no agreed-upon time system or zones, and there’s neither GPS nor internet on the moon.

Setting those up will require developing new technologies on Earth to be deployed 239,000 miles away. Javier Ventura-Traveset, an engineer at the European Space Agency, is leading this work with a project called Moonlight, which aims to design satellites for astronauts and robotic explorers. Moonlight and its US counterpart, the Lunar Communications Relay and Navigation Systems, will support NASA’s [Artemis program](https://www.wired.com/tag/artemis/), and the work is raising questions about whether the moon should have a single time zone—and how that would work.

NASA’s Apollo missions didn’t need all this stuff. A few astronauts visited, completed their work, and then flew home. But space agencies’ plans for the 21st century call for a permanent human presence on the moon, potentially with people from Europe, the US, Japan, China, and Canada there at the same time. “Up to now, when you have a mission on the moon, you would always synchronize with a time zone on the Earth. But we’ll have many missions in the future, and having a common reference time is really needed,” Ventura-Traveset says.

That poses logistical and engineering challenges and gives rise to significant political and philosophical ones. What *is* time on the moon?

Pretty much everyone agrees on the definition of a second. (It’s [9,192,631,770 cycles](https://www.wired.com/story/the-quest-to-perfect-the-universal-language-of-science/) of microwave radiation emitted by a cesium atom, if you’re curious.) But that’s not really helpful when it comes to navigating everyday life. People need larger chunks of time to do things like set a clock or run a computer or know when to go to work or how long it takes to get from point A to point B. On Earth, we use a 24-hour day, based on the planet’s rotation and cycles of light and dark, to which [our](https://www.wired.com/story/got-jet-lag-consider-hacking-your-circadian-rhythm/) [circadian](https://www.wired.com/story/the-pandemic-changed-sleep-habits-maybe-thats-a-good-thing/) [rhythms](https://www.wired.com/story/why-does-asthma-get-worse-at-night/) are tuned.

But our lunar neighbor rotates much more slowly—every 29.5 Earth days. This means a particular side of the moon stays illuminated or pointed away from the sun for long periods. (On Earth, we don’t notice this lunar rotation because the moon is tidally locked with us. It takes as long to revolve along its axis as it does to rotate around the planet, so the same side of the moon always faces us.) People like Ventura-Traveset need to define what time means in a place where many of the cues we use on Earth—sunrise, sunset, rush hour, prime time—are no longer there to guide us.

Whether space agencies adopt a single time zone or several hasn’t been decided yet, Ventura-Traveset says. Given the moon’s slow rotation, he thinks it makes sense to have fewer than Earth’s 24 zones. To him, one zone would be the most practical and natural: We’d reproduce something like Coordinated Universal Time so astronauts could follow a 24-hour cycle as they do on the [International Space Station](https://www.wired.com/tag/international-space-station/). Sure, each day will be out of sync with the moon’s light and dark periods, but he doesn’t think it makes sense to have a weeks-long “day” followed by a weeks-long “night.”

But he does note one counterargument: A 24-zone system would make it easier for astronauts from different countries to communicate with people in their home regions. After all, syncing between heavenly bodies has been a constant challenge for operators of [missions to Mars](https://www.wired.com/story/lets-go-to-mars-lets-not-live-there/). The Martian day, or Sol, is 24 hours and 39 minutes. That’s 3 percent longer than an Earth day, and it has made things difficult for the operators of NASA’s [Mars rovers](https://www.wired.com/tag/mars-rover/), who have to spend their work lives on Martian time and their personal lives on Earth time. “If the experience of continuously changing local time every day sounds like it could feel like relentless jet lag, you are correct,” Zara Mirmalek, a social scientist at NASA Ames Research Center and author of [*Making Time on Mars*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262043854/making-time-on-mars/), wrote in an email to WIRED. Working remotely can have its drawbacks.

Erika Nesvold, [space ethicist](https://www.wired.com/story/erika-nesvold-what-will-ethical-space-exploration-look-like/) and author of the book *Off-Earth*, also asks: *Who* *gets to decide what time it is on the moon?* These decisions are often politically fraught on Earth, and they could prove to be so on other worlds. Consider the confusing wiggly lines of our planet’s time zones: Some vast countries like China operate on a single time. Others, like Iran, are offset from their neighbors. And of course there’s that perennial [dispute about daylight saving time](https://www.wired.com/story/2023-daylight-saving-time/), which this year gave rise to two [rival time zones in Lebanon](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65079574). If it looks like space agencies in Europe and the US are imposing lunar time zones, she says, other nations could consider it a step toward [colonialism on the moon](https://www.centerforenvironmentalrights.org/news/imposing-lunar-time-zones-a-giant-leap-toward-colonizing-the-moon).

The current effort isn’t completely limited to Western nations, Ventura-Traveset argues. For these time-related decisions, his team is working with an interagency organization that includes Chinese observers. The ESA and NASA groups are also planning to provide recommendations that could be discussed at the [International Astronomical Union](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/dwarf-planets-arent-big-news-astronomy-great-job/), whose national members include every spacefaring nation, wrote Joshua Finch, a NASA spokesperson, in an email to WIRED.

The project of setting the time on the moon is wrapped up in navigation and communication systems, which depend on precise timekeeping. After all, astronauts will need to know exactly where they are, *when* they are, and how to coordinate with others. On Earth, we rely on rubidium atomic clocks aboard the US’ [GPS](https://www.wired.com/story/gps-iiis-long-journey-is-picking-up-speed/) or [Europe’s Galileo](https://www.wired.com/story/galileo-satellite-outage-gps/) satellite systems. The signal from a satellite tells you both the time and exactly where you’re located.

“If your clock is off, you’ll make an error,” says Biju Patla, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, whose cesium atomic clock serves as the US’ time and frequency standard. A few nanoseconds off time-wise can mean a whole meter off distance-wise. That might not matter for a pedestrian looking at a map on their phone, but it would be a big deal for a lunar rover operator trying to steer around a boulder or a crater, he says.

This is where Moonlight will come in. The system may involve three navigation satellites in lunar orbit plus one dedicated to communication. That way, multiple satellites can ping Earth at any given time, and the system would be resilient if a single orbiter fails. (Because the moon lacks an atmosphere, the satellites would be more vulnerable to [solar](https://www.wired.com/story/tiny-explosive-jetlets-might-be-fueling-the-solar-wind/) [storms](https://www.wired.com/story/sun-storm-end-civilization/) and other space weather than the GPS or Galileo systems.)

Most of the technologies needed for Moonlight are already available, since the ESA and NASA already have satellites orbiting Earth. But the moon project comes with its own challenges. For example, if one were to place an atomic clock on the moon and compare it to an identical one on the Earth, the lunar device would gain 56 microseconds every 24 hours. That would add up, eventually messing with the precision of navigation systems.

This misalignment happens because of general relativity, thanks to the moon’s lower gravitational pull, says Patla. Technically, the ideal measure of time would come from an [atomic clock in the vacuum of space](https://www.wired.com/story/this-atomic-clock-will-transform-deep-space-exploration/), where there’s essentially no gravity. Atomic clocks on Earth are affected by the planet’s gravity, but they’re a known standard. Lunar time would be affected by a different gravitational pull that would contribute to the additional microseconds. Still, it’s not a huge problem: The lunar time offset is predictable and can be corrected.

There’s also the question of what orbital path those satellites should take. Most satellites around Earth have circular orbits, and that’s useful for a population that’s sparse at the planet’s poles and spread throughout the middle latitudes. But realistically, most astronauts in the next decade or two will be stationed near the lunar south pole because it hosts [water ice](https://www.wired.com/story/how-do-you-prove-theres-ice-on-the-moon-with-a-lunar-flashlight/) that people [want to mine](https://www.wired.com/story/rovers-are-so-yesterday-its-time-to-send-a-snakebot-to-space/). The ESA is looking into deploying the satellites on elliptical orbits so that they’ll have more time within range of polar regions. Later, the agency and its partners could add satellites on different orbits to better cover other areas, and ground stations for additional accuracy.

The satellites will use a different frequency (S-band, at around 2 to 2.5 megahertz) than their terrestrial counterparts (L-band, at about 1 to 1.6 MHz) so that their signals don’t interfere with Earth-based communications or disrupt future radio telescopes on the [far side of the moon](https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-might-put-a-huge-telescope-on-the-far-side-of-the-moon/).

The ESA is planning to launch a technology-testing satellite called Lunar Pathfinder by the end of 2025, and then have Moonlight’s “initial operational capability” ready by the end of 2027, with a dedicated satellite providing limited communication services and a first navigation ranging signal. The full constellation of—most likely—four satellites would be operational by the end of 2030.

And Moonlight won’t be alone. NASA’s developing its own analogous system, working on a similar schedule. The Chinese space agency is planning its satellite constellation as well, and some of those spacecraft could launch by the end of 2024, with the initial goal of supporting Chang’e 6, a lunar sample return mission. The Japanese space agency has one in the works too, with a demonstration mission scheduled for 2028.

These initiatives will play a fundamental role in the future of space travel, Ventura-Traveset says. New generations of spacecraft, including commercial ones, won’t need complex, expensive antennas or landing systems; they can simply tap into these. “There are more than 250 missions over the next 10 years intending to go to the moon,” he says. “We need to have this infrastructure. It will be an accelerator for the moon economy.”

On a philosophical level, these programs represent a profound shift in the concept of timekeeping, says Nesvold. “Throughout most of human history, we have used space to tell time by, including the plants and stars and phases of the moon,” she says. “It’s only relatively recently that we have come up with this idea of clock technology, which lets us coordinate with each other without having to depend on space. And now we’re implementing this technology on the moon itself.”
