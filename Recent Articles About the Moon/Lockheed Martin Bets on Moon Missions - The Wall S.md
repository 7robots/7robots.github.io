[Lockheed Martin](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LMT) Corp. [LMT -0.41%decrease; red down pointing triangle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LMT?mod=chiclets) said it is launching a lunar-infrastructure division that would provide communications services for moon missions.

Crescent Space Services LLC, a subsidiary of the aerospace giant, will begin operations by developing a satellite network for the moon, according to Joe Landon, its chief executive. That network would allow people and hardware on the lunar surface or in orbit around the moon to communicate back to Earth and provide navigation information, akin to GPS, he said.
