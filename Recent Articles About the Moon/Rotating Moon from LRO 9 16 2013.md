# Rotating Moon from LRO 9/16/2013

**Explanation:**  No one, presently, sees the Moon rotate like this. That's because the Earth's moon is tidally locked to the Earth, showing us [only one side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33_tUHDkMY). Given modern digital technology, however, combined with many detailed images returned by the [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/) (LRO), a high resolution virtual [Moon rotation movie](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/790-A-Unique-View-Of-The-Moon.html) has now been composed. The [above time-lapse video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNUNB6CMnE8) starts with the standard Earth [view of the Moon](http://www.google.com/moon/). Quickly, though, [Mare Orientale](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110312.html), a large crater with a dark center that is difficult to see from the Earth, rotates into view just below the equator. From an entire [lunar month](http://www.universetoday.com/19699/does-the-moon-rotate/) condensed into 24 seconds, the video clearly shows that the Earth side of the Moon contains an abundance of [dark lunar maria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maria_on_the_Moon), while the lunar far side is dominated by bright [lunar highlands](http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/moon/moon_surface.html). Two [new missions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_and_future_lunar_missions) are scheduled to begin exploring the Moon within the year, the first of which is NASA's [Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ladee/main/index.html) (LADEE). LADEE, which [launched](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130911.html) just over a week ago, is scheduled to begin orbiting the Moon in October and will explore the thin and unusual [atmosphere of the Moon](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LADEE/news/lunar-atmosphere.html). In a few months, the [Chinese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) [Chang'e 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_3) is scheduled to launch, a mission that includes a soft lander that will dispatch a robotic rover.
