# What is the History of the Moon

**Explanation:**  What is the history of the Moon? [The Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) was likely created from [debris expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis) when a Mars-sized object violently [impacted the Earth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7VOAM-rbB8) about 4.5 billion years ago. Just after gravitationally condensing, as [imagined](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIKmSQqp8wY) [above](http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a010900/a010930/), the glowing-hot surface of the Moon cooled and cracked. Rocks large and small continued to impact the surface, including a particularly large impact that created [Aitken Basin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken_basin) about 4.3 billion years ago. A [Heavy Bombardment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Bombardment_Period) period then continued for hundreds of millions of years, creating large basins all over the lunar surface. Over the next few billion years lava flowed into [Earth-side basins](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110303.html), eventually cooling into the dark maria we see today. As always, relentless impacts continued, forming the [craters](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/explore/shaping_the_planets/impact_cratering.shtml) we see today, slowly diminishing over the past billion years. Today the cooled Moon we know and [love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLfTjTLnVIo) is as [dark as coal](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_qyhZ9_eXCHM/TFiStYEuNlI/AAAAAAAAF8g/JwtiTY5H8BU/s400/coal_hands.jpg) and always keeps the same face toward Earth. Exactly how the [Moon formed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibV4MdN5wo0) initially, and why [lunar maria](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983Natur.302..233S) are only on the Earth side, remain active topics of research.
