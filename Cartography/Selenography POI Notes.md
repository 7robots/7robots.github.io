# Selenography POI Notes

Nearside North:

```other
* Plato Crater:
	○ lava-filled impact crater. 101km in diameter.
	○ Located on northeastern shore of Mare Imbrium.
	○ Age about 3.84 billion years, slightly younger than Mare Imbrium.
	○ Viewings of Plato sometimes report transient lunar phenomena like “mists,” “fogs,” flashes of light, unusual colors — likely the result of viewing conditions.
	○ A slump of the western wall separated a huge triangular block from the rim but it did not collapse onto the crater floor.
	○ The lava-filled floor looks like a giants’ skating rink; sharp-eyed observers may see the largest of the pits on its floor.
	○ (Home of Matthew Looney)
* Plato Rilles:
	○ 180km in length
	○ A variety of sinuous rilles cut Imbrium rubble east of Plato
	○ Only the northernmost are visible
* Helicon and Le Verrier
	○ 24km and 21 km in diameter respectively
	○ The two largest craters in northern Imbrium
	○ Although they look similar, each are of very different age
	○ Le Verrier’s ejecta covers the surrounding mare
	○ Helicon is covered by the mare, therefore is older than both the Mare lava flow and Le Verrier
* Philolaus:
	○ 70km in diameter
	○ Relatively new and rayless crater overlapping and filling  an older, 90km ring
	○ Impact melt fills the eastern side of the floor
	○ 2 large separated peaks and smaller ones, rather than a single, central massif
* Anaxagoras
	○ 51km in diameter
	○ Rayed crater w/ few rays to the west
	○ Likely due to an oblique impact
* Mare Imbrium
* Mare Frigoris
