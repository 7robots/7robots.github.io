Assessment Criteria,Intact Capture,Coaccretion,Earth Fission,Collisional Ejection,Disintegrative Capture
Lunar Mass (Moon is very large relative to Earth compared to other moons),B,B,D,I,B
Earth-Moon Angular Momentum,C,F,F,B,C
Volatile Element Depletion (most volatile elements seen on Earth have been burned off the Moon),C,C,B,B,C
"Iron Depletion (relative to Earth and other moons, the Moon does not have much of an iron core)",F,D,A,I,B
"Oxygen Isotopes (Oxygen isotope mix across the solar system is quite unique as you go from planetary body to planetary body. However, earth and moon have almost identical oxygen isotope mixes. Did they form right next to each other or did Moon come from Earth material?)",B,A,A,B,B
(Similarity of Mantle Trace Element Patterns),C,D,A,C,C
Magma Ocean (It is quite clear that the various Mares on the Moon are large basins filled with magma. The moon undoubtedly had a large magma ocean for some period of time),D,C,A,A,B
Physical Plausibility (Does this theory make much sense practically speaking?),D-,C,F,I,F
