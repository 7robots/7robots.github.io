**Explanation:**  The brilliant [full Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000113.html) might not have looked quite like this to skygazers this week, but [the image is a mosaic](http://celestialwonders.com/InvertedFullMoon_12082003.html) of 18 digital frames recorded on December 9th at 3:30 UT. At that time, the Moon was only about seven hours past its exact [full phase](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/moon_phases.html) or time of maximum illumination [as viewed](http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/vphase.html) from Earth. Here, the pixel values corresponding to light and dark areas have been translated in reverse, or inverted, producing a false-color representation reminiscent of a black and white [photographic negative](http://www.r-cube.co.uk/fox-talbot/index.html). Normally bright rays from the large [crater Tycho](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010809.html) dominate the southern (bottom) features as easily followed dark lines emanating from the 85 kilometer diameter impact site. Normally dark [lunar mare](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap001228.html) appear light and silvery. Traditionally, [astronomical images](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960406.html) recorded on [photographic plates](http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~afs5z/photography.html) were directly examined in this negative color scheme, which can help the eye pick out faint details.
