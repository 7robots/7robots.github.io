**Explanation:**  What is so super about tomorrow's supermoon? [Tomorrow](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/10jul_supermoons/), a full moon will occur that appears slightly larger and brighter than usual. The reason is that the Moon's fully illuminated phase occurs within a short time from perigee - when the Moon is its closest to the Earth in its elliptical orbit. Although the precise conditions that define a [supermoon](http://www.universetoday.com/113548/get-set-for-super-duper-moon-2-of-3-for-2014/) vary, given one definition, tomorrow's will be the third supermoon of the year–and the third consecutive month that a supermoon occurs. One reason [supermoons](http://earthsky.org/space/what-is-a-supermoon) are popular is because they are so easy to see–just go outside and sunset and watch an impressive full moon rise! Since perigee actually occurs today, tonight's sunset [moonrise](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140907.html) should also be impressive. [Pictured above](http://www.astrosnake.com/gallery/moon.htm), a [supermoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon) from 2012 is compared to a micromoon–when a full Moon occurs near the furthest part of the Moon's orbit -- so that it appears smaller and dimmer than usual. Given many definitions, at least one [supermoon](http://www.universetoday.com/102763/what-is-a-super-moon/) occurs each year, with the next being 2015 August 30.
