**Explanation:**  How did this spherule come to be on the Moon? When a [meteorite](http://www.nineplanets.org/meteorites.html) strikes the [Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/moon.html), the [energy of the impact](http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast30nov_1.htm) melts some of the [splattering rock](http://www.teachersource.com/micrometeorites.htm), a fraction of which might cool into tiny [glass beads](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010523.html). Many of these [glass beads](http://www.geocities.com/ladysveva/BeadHistory.html) were present in [lunar soil samples](http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/curator/lunar/lunar.htm) returned to Earth by the [Apollo missions](http://www.nasm.edu/apollo/). [Pictured above](http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/lunar-spherule.html) is one such glass [spherule](http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/spherule) that measures only a quarter of a [millimeter](http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/everyday.htm) across. This [spherule](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040210.html) is particularly interesting because it has been victim to an even smaller impact. A miniature [crater](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990711.html) is visible on the upper left, surrounded by a fragmented area caused by the [shockwaves](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010623.html) of the small impact. By [dating](http://www.dc.peachnet.edu/~pgore/geology/geo102/radio.htm) many of these impacts, some [astronomers estimate](http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/lunar-spherule.html) that [cratering](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010428.html) on our Moon [increased](http://www.sciencenews.org/20000311/fob3.asp) roughly 500 million years ago and continues even today.
