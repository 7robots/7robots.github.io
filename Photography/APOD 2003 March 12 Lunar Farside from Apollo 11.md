**Explanation:**  The far side of the [Moon](http://www.nineplanets.org/luna.html) is rough and filled with [craters](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010428.html). By comparison, the near side of the [Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/moon.html), the side we always see, is relatively smooth. Since the [Moon is rotation locked](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010218.html) to always point the same side toward [Earth](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg), humanity has only glimpsed the [lunar farside](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap001021.html) recentlyâ€“last century. The light [highlands](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch13-7.html) of the [far side](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap981008.html) are older than the dark [Maria](http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/planet_volcano/lunar/mare/mlm.html) of the near side. A thinner crust on the near side that allowed for more dark [lava flows](http://cmex-www.arc.nasa.gov/CMEX/data/catalog/RecentVolcanismOnMars/LunarLavaFlow.html) is thought to be the cause of differences between the two sides. The cause for the [crust](http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/moon/lunar_interior_structure.html) thickness differences is still being researched, however. The large impact basin [pictured above](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap11ann/kippsphotos/apollo.html) is [Crater 308](http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/moon/moon_surface.html). It spans about 30 kilometers and [was photographed](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solar/mooncrater.html) by crew of [Apollo 11](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap11ann/introduction.htm) as they circled the Moon in 1969.
