**Explanation:**  Why is the [Moon dusty](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/Apollo17/A17_Experiments_SMI.html)? On Earth, rocks are weathered by wind and water, creating soil and sand. [On the Moon](http://www.nineplanets.org/luna.html), the long history of [micrometeorite](http://www.solarviews.com/eng/edu/micromet.htm) bombardment has blasted away at [the rocky surface](http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/curator/lunar/lunar.htm) creating a layer of powdery [lunar soil or regolith](http://epsc.wustl.edu/admin/resources/meteorites/regolith_breccia.html). This lunar regolith could be a scientific and [industrial](http://www.asi.org/adb/02/02/regolith-volatiles.html) bonanza. But for the Apollo astronauts and [their equipment](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/Apollo17/A17_science.html), the pervasive, fine, gritty dust was definitely a problem. [On the lunar surface](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/) in December 1972, [Apollo 17](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030111.html) astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan needed to repair one of their lunar rover's fenders [in an effort](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a17/a17.eva2prep.html) to keep the "rooster tails" of dust away from themselves and their gear. This picture reveals the wheel and fender of their dust covered [rover along with](http://www.clavius.org/rover2.html) the ingenious application of spare maps, clamps, and a grey strip of "duct tape".
