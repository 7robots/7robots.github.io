**Explanation:**  This panorama of the cratered lunar surface was constructed from images returned by the [US Surveyor](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/surveyor.html) 6 lander. [Surveyor 6](http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/pub/expmoon/surveyor/Surveyor6.html) was not the [first spacecraft to accomplish a soft landing](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970907.html) on the Moon ... but it was the first to [land and then lift off](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960609.html) again! After touching down near the center [of the Moon's nearside](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/data/) in November of 1967, NASA controllers commanded the spacecraft to *hop*. Briefly firing its rocket engine and lifting itself some 4 meters above the surface, [the Surveyor](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap981114.html) moved about 2.5 meters to one side before setting down again. [The hopping success of Surveyor 6](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap961103.html) essentially marked the completion of [the Surveyor series main mission](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/TM-3487/ch2-1.htm) - to determine if the lunar terrain was safe for [the planned Apollo landings](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/).
