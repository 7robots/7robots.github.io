**Explanation:**  Is there enough water on the moon to sustain future astronauts? The question has important implications if humanity hopes to use the Moon as a future outpost. [Last year](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091118.html), to help find out, scientists [crashed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVyEOFfv_lo) the moon-orbiting [LCROSS spacecraft](http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/mission.htm) into a permanently shadowed crater near the Moon's South Pole. New [analyses](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/330/6003/434) of the resulting plume from [Cabeus crater](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091008.html) indicate more water than previously thought, possibly about six percent. [Additionally](http://planetary.org/blog/article/00002728/), an [instrument](http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/lend.html) on the separate [LRO spacecraft](http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/) that measures neutrons indicates that even larger lunar expansesâ€“most not even permanently shadowed -- may also contain a significant amount of buried frozen water. [Pictured above](http://uanews.org/node/34940) from LRO, areas in false-color blue indicate the presence of soil relatively rich in [hydrogen](http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/1.html), which is thought likely bound to sub-surface water ice. Conversely, the red areas are likely dry. The location of the [Moon's South Pole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap951128.html) is also digitally marked on the image. How deep beneath the surface the [ice crystals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Snow_crystals.jpg) permeate is still unknown, as well as how difficult it would be to [mine](http://rimg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/extract/60/1/597) the crystals and purify them into [drinking water](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050401.html).
