**Explanation:**  Many bright nebulae and star clusters in planet Earth's sky are associated with the name of [astronomer Charles Messier](http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/Messier/xtra/history/m-cat.html), from his famous 18th century catalog. [His name is also given](http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/Messier/xtra/m-crater.html) to these two large and remarkable craters on the Moon. Standouts in the dark, smooth lunar Sea of Fertility or Mare Fecunditatis, Messier (left) and Messier A have dimensions of 15 by 8 and 16 by 11 kilometers respectively. Their elongated shapes are explained by an extremely shallow-angle trajectory followed by [the impactor](http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/education/activities/active15a.htm), moving left to right, [that gouged out the craters](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304151.html). The shallow impact also resulted in two [bright rays](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050305.html) of material extending along the surface to the right, beyond the picture. Intended to be viewed with [red/blue glasses](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/Help/VendorList.html#Glasses) (red for the left eye), this striking stereo picture of the crater pair was recently created from high resolution scans of two images ([AS11-42-6304](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS11-42-6304), [AS11-42-6305](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS11-42-6305)) taken during the Apollo 11 mission to the moon.
