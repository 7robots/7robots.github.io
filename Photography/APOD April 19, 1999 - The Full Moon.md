**Explanation:**  Earth has one moon. A symbol in famous [love songs](http://www.primenet.com/~tansy/audrey/moon.html), [movies](http://www.rscreations.com/werewolf/movies/index.html), [poems](http://205.121.65.141/Millville/teachers/carles/carles96_97/writing/moonpoems.htm), and [folklore](http://peacock.tnjc.edu.tw/MOON/moon.html), many [myths](http://www.pantheon.org/mythica/articles/m/man_in_moon.html) about the [Moon](http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html) date back to ancient history. In fact, the name [Monday originates from Moon-day](http://www.greenheart.com/billh/origin.html). The Moon glows by light it reflects from the [Sun](http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html) and is frequently the brightest object in the night sky. The [Moon](http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/solar_system/moon.html) orbits the Earth about once a month (moon-th) from about 1 light second away. The [above-pictured Full Moon](http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/14/extra-photos.html) occurs when the Moon is nearly opposite to the Sun in its orbit. The Moon's diameter is about 1/4 that of the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990131.html), and from the Earth's surface appears to have almost exactly the same angular size as the Sun. Recent [evidence indicates](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990326.html) that the [Moon](http://stardate.utexas.edu/resources/ssguide/moon.html) formed from a colossal impact on the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990131.html) about 4.5 billions of years ago, and therefore has a similar composition to the Earth. [Humans walked on the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap981004.html) for the first time in 1969.
