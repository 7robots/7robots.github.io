**Explanation:**  On July 21, 1969 Apollo 11 astronauts [Neil A. Armstrong](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap950921.html) and [Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin Jr.](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960420.html) [lifted off the lunar surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960609.html) in the ascent stage of their lunar module dubbed "The Eagle"â€“after becoming the first to walk on the moon. Seen here the Eagle soars towards a rendezvous with the orbiting Command Module piloted by [Michael Collins](http://ees5-www.lanl.gov/APOLLO/a11.crew.html#collinsbio). [The smooth, dark mare area](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960112.html) on the surface below is Mare Smithii located just below the equator on the extreme eastern edge of [the lunar nearside](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap950903.html). The Earth is visible hanging [above the moon's](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/moon.html) western horizon.
