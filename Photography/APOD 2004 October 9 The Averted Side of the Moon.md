**Explanation:**  This vintage 60-kopek stamp celebrates a dramatic achievement. On the 7th of October, [1959](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunartimeline.html) (7/X/1959), the Soviet interplanetary station which has come to be [called "Luna 3"](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/database/www-nmc?59-008A) successfully photographed the [far side](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap981008.html) of the moon giving denizens of planet Earth their [first ever view](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap950914.html) of this [hidden](http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/dark_side.html) [hemisphere](http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/moon_spin.html). Lacking the digital [image technology](http://willmclaughlin.astrodigitals.com/) familiar now, Luna 3 took the pictures on 35mm film which was automatically developed on board. The pictures were then scanned and [the signal transmitted](http://www.users.wineasy.se/svengrahn/trackind/jodrell/jodrole1.htm#luna3fars) to Earth days later in what was perhaps also the first interplanetary fax. In all, [seventeen pictures](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/database/www-nmc?59-008A-01) were received providing enough coverage and resolution to construct a far side map and identify a few major features. [Depicted on](http://vesuvius.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/stamps.html) the stamp are regions dubbed the Sea of Moscow, the Soviet Mountains, the Bay of Astronauts, and the Sea of Dreams.
