**Explanation:**  Awkward and angular looking, Apollo 17's lunar module [Challenger](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/tmp/1972-096C.html) was designed for flight in the vacuum of space. This picture from command module [America](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/tmp/1972-096A.html), shows Challenger's ascent stage in lunar orbit. Small reaction control thrusters are at the sides of [the moonship](http://users.specdata.com/home/pullo/lm_mis1.htm) with the bell of the ascent rocket engine underneath. The hatch allowing [access to the lunar surface](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17main.html) is seen at the front, with a round radar antenna at the top. Mission commander Gene Cernan is just visible through the dark, triangular window. This spaceship performed gracefully, landing on the Moon [and returning](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/movie/as17_liftoff2.mov) the Apollo astronauts to the orbiting command module in December of 1972. So [where is Challenger now?](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apolloloc.html) Its descent stage [remains](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~durda/Apollo/ls_17_5aa.html) at the Apollo 17 [landing site](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~durda/Apollo/landing_sites.html), Taurus-Littrow. The ascent stage was intentionally crashed nearby after being jettisoned from the command module prior to [the astronauts' return](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.homeward.html) to planet Earth. [Apollo 17's mission](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap051210.html) was the sixth and last time astronauts have landed on the Moon.
