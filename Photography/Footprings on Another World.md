**Explanation:**  [On July 20th, 1969](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap11ann/introduction.htm), humans first set foot on the [Moon](http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html). Taken from a window of their Apollo 11 lunar module, the Eagle, this picture shows the footprints in the [powdery lunar soil](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011110.html) made by astronauts [Neil Armstrong](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap11ann/kippsphotos/5528.jpg) and [Buzz Aldrin](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap11ann/kippsphotos/5390.jpg). It has been estimated that one billion people on [planet Earth watched](http://guinan.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/videos/historical.html) Armstrong step from the lander onto the [surface of another world](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/), making this live transmission one of the highest rated television shows ever. In the foreground at right, a rocket nozzle on the side of the Eagle is seen in silhouette, while beyond an unfurled [United States](http://aesp.nasa.okstate.edu/fieldguide/) flag is the television camera, remounted on a stand to better view the landing area. The [Apollo missions](http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/history/apollo/apollo.html) to the Moon have been described as the result of the greatest technological mobilization in [history](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/).
