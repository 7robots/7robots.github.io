# Eternal Return

What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ’This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself."

– Friedrich Nietzsche, Aphorism 341 from “The Gay Science”
