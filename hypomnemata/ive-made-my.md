Lonni: 

And what do you sacrifice?

Luthen:

Calm. Kindness, kinship. Love. Iâ€™ve given up all chance at inner peace, Iâ€™ve made my mind a sunless space. I share my dreams with ghosts. I wake up every day to an equation I wrote 15 years ago from which thereâ€™s only one conclusion: Iâ€™m damned for what I do. My anger, my ego, my unwillingness to yield, my eagerness to fight, theyâ€™ve set me on a path from which there is no escape. I yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost, and by the time I looked down, there was no longer any ground beneath my feet.

What is... what is my sacrifice? Iâ€™m condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone elseâ€™s future. I burn my life, to make a sunrise that I know Iâ€™ll never see. No, the ego that started this fight will never have a mirror, or an audience, or the light of gratitude. So what do I sacrifice?

Everything!  ðŸ’¬
