# This is just to say

This is just to say

I will listen

for you

I will hear

all the words

In the world

All the

delicious

ineffable

effable

sounds

all the

thrumming

and

humming

and

tintinnabulating

Sounds

I will hear

all the sounds

in the

world

and i will write them down

so you

can

hear

them

too.
