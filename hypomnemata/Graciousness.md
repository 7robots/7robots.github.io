# Graciousness

&quotBecause whenever people come together to help either another person or another creature, something has happened, and everyone wants to know about it—because we all long to know that there’s a graciousness at the heart of creation.”

☐ Mr Rogers, quoted in “My Friend Mr Rogers” by Tom Junod
