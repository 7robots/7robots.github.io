# A Better Poet than Swordsman

tegeus-Cromis, sometime soldier and sophisticate of Virconium, the Pastel City, who now dwelt quite alone in a tower by the sea and imagined himself a better poet than swordsman, stood at early morning on the sand dunes that lay between his tall home and the grey line of the surf.

Excerpt from &quotThe Pastel City&quot by M. John Harrison
