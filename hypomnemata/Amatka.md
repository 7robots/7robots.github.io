# Amatka

"A person creates the word. Gives in to the world, and becomes the word." It sounded like a sigh. "You have no words. You have been separated." Separated from her words. The world was built on a new language, and she would not be part of it, only an observer, a watcher. Berols' Anna turned her head and gazed out on the chaos. "When all of this has become, you will remain; the people like you will remain, all of you, as you are, separate. But we will carry you." She stroked Vanja's cheek. "We will always carry you, little herald."

From Karin Tidbeck. "Amatka."
