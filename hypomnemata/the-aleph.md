I saw the Aleph from every point and angle, and in the Aleph I saw the earth and in the earth the Aleph and in the Aleph the earth; I saw my own face and my own bowels; I saw your face; and I felt dizzy and wept, for my eyes had seen that secret and conjectured object whose name is common to all men but which no man has looked upon â€“ the unimaginable universe.

I felt infinite wonder, infinite pity.

- From The Aleph by Jorge Luis Borges ðŸ“š ðŸ’¬
