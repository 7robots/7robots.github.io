Picture a wave in the ocean.

You can see it, measure it, its height, the way the sunlight refracts when it passes through, and itâ€™s there, and you can see it, you know what it is.

Itâ€™s a wave.

And then it crashes on the shore and itâ€™s gone.

But the water is still there.

The wave was just a different way for the water to be for a little while.

Thatâ€™s one conception of death for a Buddhist.

The wave returns to the ocean, where it came from, and where itâ€™s supposed to be.
