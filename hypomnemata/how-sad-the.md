‚ÄúHow sad the evening earth! How mysterious the mists over the swamps! He who has wandered in these mists, he who has suffered much before death, he who has flown over this earth bearing on himself too heavy a burden, knows it. The weary man knows it. And without regret he leaves the mists of the earth, its swamps and rivers, with a light heart he gives himself into the hands of death, knowing that she alone can bring him peace.‚Äù

From Mikhail Bulgakov. ‚ÄúTHE MASTER AND MARGARITA‚Äù üìö üí¨
