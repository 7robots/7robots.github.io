# Virconium

## from The Pastel City

tegeus-Cromis, sometime soldier and sophisticate of Virconium, the Pastel City, who now dwelt quite alone in a tower by the sea and imagined himself a better poet than swordsman, stood at early morning on the sand dunes that lay between his tall home and the grey line of the surf.

Excerpt from ”The Pastel City” by M. John Harrison

## from A Storm of Wings

In this time, in the Time of the Locust, when we have nothing to ourselves but the hollowness within us, in the Time of Bone, when we have nothing to do but wait, nothing human moves here.
