# Cloud Atlas

I watched clouds a wobbly from the floor o’ that kayak. Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, an’ tho’ a cloud’s shape nor hue nor size don’t stay the same, it’s still a cloud an’ so is a soul. Who can say where the cloud’s blowed from or who the soul’ll be ‘morrow? Only Sonmi the east an’ the west an’ the compass an ‘ the atlas, yay, only the atlas o’ clouds.

from David Mitchell. “Cloud Atlas”
