# Be taught now among the trees and rocks

"Be taught now, among the trees and rocks

how the discarded is woven into shelter, learn the way things hidden and unspoken

slowly proclaim their voice in the world. Find that far inward symmetry to all outward appearances, apprentice

yourself to yourself,

begin to welcome back

all you sent away, be a new annunciation, make yourself a door through which

to be hospitable, even to the stranger in you."

- David Whyte
