# The fox said

“What are those doing there, Borne?” They did loll, they did sag, the faces looking down at the floor. Those were three dead bodies on the wall, three skeleton corpses.

“Oh, the dead astronauts? The fox said I needed to jazz up the place. I needed to give it some pizzazz, some oomph.”

Excerpt From: Jeff VanderMeer. “Borne.”
