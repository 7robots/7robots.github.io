# Be My Knife

So I will shut my eyes tight and write quickly: I wish that two total strangers could overcome strangeness itself, the mighty, ingrained principle of foreignness, the whole overstuffed Politburo sitting so deep in our souls. We could be like two people who inject themselves with truth serum and at long last have to tell it, the truth. I want to be able to say to myself, “I bled truth with her,” yes, that’s what I want. Be a knife for me, and I, I swear, will be a knife for you …

from David Grossman. “Be My Knife”
