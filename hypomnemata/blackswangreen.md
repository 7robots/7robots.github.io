The sequence of doors we passed made me think of all the rooms of my past and future. The hospital ward I was born in, classrooms, tents, churches, offices, hotels, museums, nursing homes, the room Iâ€™ll die in. (Has it been built yet?) Carsâ€™re rooms. So are woods. Skiesâ€™re ceilings. Distancesâ€™re walls. Wombsâ€™re rooms made of mothers. Gravesâ€™re rooms made of soil.

That music was swelling.

A Jules Verne hi-fi, all silvery knobs and dials, occupied one corner of the solarium. Madame Crommelynck sat on her cane throne, eyes shut, listening. As if the music was a warm bath. (This time I knew she wouldnâ€™t be speaking for a while, so I just sat down on the armless sofa.) A classical L.P. was playing. Nothing like the rumpty-tump-tump stuff Mr.Â Kempsey plays in Music. Jealous and sweet, this music was, sobbing and gorgeous, muddy and crystal. But if the right words existed the music wouldnâ€™t need to.

The pianoâ€™d vanished. Now a fluteâ€™d joined the violin.

(I can still hear it, hours later.)
