# APOD 2017 25 Oct - Marius Hills and a Hole in the Moon

![MariusHills_LO2LRO_1080.jpeg](APOD%202017%2025%20Oct%20-%20Marius%20Hills%20and%20a%20Hole%20in%20the%20.assets/MariusHills_LO2LRO_1080.jpeg)

**Explanation:**  Could humans live beneath the surface of the Moon? This intriguing possibility was bolstered in 2009 when Japan's Moon-orbiting [SELENE spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SELENE) imaged a curious hole beneath the Marius Hills region on the Moon, possibly a [skylight](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12954) to an underground lava tube. [Follow-up observations](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/lunar-pits-could-shelter-astronauts-reveal-details-of-how-man-in-the-moon-formed) by NASA's [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/overview/index.html) (LRO) indicated that the [Marius Hills Hole](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/12jul_rabbithole) (MHH) visually extends down nearly 100 meters and is several hundred meters wide. Most recently, ground penetrating radar [data from SELENE](http://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/selene/) has been [re-analyzed to reveal](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL074998/epdf) a series of intriguing second echoesâ€“indicators that the extensive lava tubes exist under Marius Hills might extend down even kilometers and be large enough to house cities. [Such tubes](https://www.universetoday.com/137550/stable-lava-tube-provide-potential-human-habitat-moon/) could [shelter a future Moon colony](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/lunar-pits-could-shelter-astronauts-reveal-details-of-how-man-in-the-moon-formed) from large temperature swings, [micro-meteor impact](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011117.html)s, and [harmful solar radiation](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031029.html). Potentially, [underground lava tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_tube#/media/File:Valentine_Cave.JPG) might even be sealed to contain [breathable](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150401.html) air. These [lava tubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQLWIuaNg68) likely formed when lunar volcanos were active billions of years ago. Pictured, the surface of [Marius Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marius_Hills) region was captured in the 1960s by NASA's [Lunar Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_program) 2 mission, while an inset image of the MHH is shown from NASA's continuing LRO. Several [volcanic dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_dome#/media/File:Volc%C3%A1n_Chait%C3%A9n-Sam_Beebe-Ecotrust.jpg)s are visible, while [Marius Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marius_(crater)) is visible on the upper right.
