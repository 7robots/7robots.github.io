# New beginnings meditation

Breathing in, I am aware of all nutriments, habits, and people who are not supportive of my well-being

Breathing out, I release and let go of all that which is not helping me toward wellness.

Breathing in, I see wellness in me.

Breathing out, I am determined to change for the better with mindful thoughts and actions.

Breathing in, I am aware of my body.

Breathing out, I smile to my heart. I vow to eat, drink, and work in ways that preserve my health and well-being
