# Walking meditation

Take two or three steps for each in-breath and each out-breath. Breathing in, say, I have arrived ; breathing out, say, I am home.

Breathing in, say, In the here ; breathing out, say, In the now.

Breathing in, say, I am solid ; breathing out, say, I am free.

Breathing in, say, In the ultimate ; breathing out, say, I dwell.

Coming home to the Earth. Returning to my source. Taking refuge in Mother Earth. Releasing all my suffering to the Earth. Mother Earth is in me. I am in Mother Earth.
